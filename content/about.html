<p>
    Hi, my name is Thanos Psaridis (also nicknamed as Thanos Fisherman).
    <br/><br/>
    I'm a software engineer from Greece specializing in Android development field and Java SE.
    I love making software by always following the latest development trends and libraries yet not sacrificing user experience. </p>
<p>
    I'm also experienced in unix systems, bash scripting as well as a great fan of open source software and solutions.</p>
<p>
    I consider myself a work in progress as I'm constantly striving for self improvement by studying and applying new techniques and coding styles. </p>
<p>
    Some of my work is included here under the projects section which can also be found online on the Playstore and GitHub. </p>
<p>
    <br/>
    Hobbies include music, guitar (I love Jazz/fusion/funk/blues and beyond), A little bit of piano and percussion.
