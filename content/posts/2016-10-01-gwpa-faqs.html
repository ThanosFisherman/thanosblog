<p>During the last few years I've been actively working on my most popular Android app GWPA Finder which initially started as a research/hobby project of mine
    but
    soon reached over 1 million users.</p>

<p>This app (formerly known as Greek WPA Finder) was <u>originally intended for use inside Greece</u> as it can recover <b>default</b> WPA Keys of specific
    router
    brands that are popular in Greece thus helping you test your network security.</p>
<br/>
<p>Nowadays there is an ongoing effort to gradually <b>support more routers around the world</b> however that's not an easy task and most of the times it
    doesn't
    reflect to what users might expect from this app. So I'd like to clarify a few things and probably shed some light about my app in the following FAQs.</p>

    <h3>GWPA Finder - FAQs</h3>


    <p><b>Is this a scam?</b><br/>
        NO it's not!</p>
    <p><b>Is this a virus?</b><br/>
        NO it's not! </p>
    <p><b>Why does my antivirus report it as a virus then?</b><br/>
        It's a false positive! Many antiviruses report legit apps as viruses sometimes.</p>
    <p><b>F*ck you man my phone reboots multiple times when I use your app</b><br/>
        That's not GWPA Finder's fault by any means. <br/>
        It could be due to a bug in your phone's firmware or Hardware. <br/>
        Sometimes Modified Android versions like Cyanogen Mod also do that. <br/>
        Try a factory reset every once in a while.</p>
    <p><b>F*ck you man your app has f*cked up my phone</b><br/>
        NO it doesn't do that. There is no hidden code that could cause problems to your device.</p>
    <p><b>It's sh*t It doesn't work. What A waste of time!</b><br/>
        K</p>
    <p><b>It used to crack more WiFi networks in the past but now it doesn't. Did you remove support for older routers?</b><br/>
        No! Rather the opposite. New algorithms have been added and more routers are now supported.<br/>
        The reason you are not able to connect to some WiFis that were previously accessible in the past, <br/>
        is because the owner is now aware of his security flaw and might have changed his default WPA Key</p>
    <p><b>Why All of the WiFi Networks appear as Not Supported?</b><br/>
        Newer routers are harder to crack and reverse engineer and they still remain vulnerability-unknown thus not yet supported.</p>
    <p><b>I can't connect to the WiFi network using the provided key even though it's marked as Supported</b><br/>
        Many reasons for this. Maybe the WiFi network is full, Maybe the signal is weak or Maybe and most likely <br/>
        the owner has changed his default WPA key.</p>
    <p><b>I managed to connect to my neightbour's WiFi should I let him know about this?</b><br/>
        The right thing to do is to inform him. But It's up to you man!</p>
    <p><b>Are all of the supported WiFi keys being stored in a database?</b><br/>
        NO. There is no database involved in this app whatsoever.</p>
    <p><b>Since you are not using a database to retrieve the supported WiFi keys then how do you do it?</b><br/>
        It's a key generator. It includes some algorithms that have been extracted by reverse engineering (hacking) <br/>
        the router's firmware</p>
    <p><b>Why can't you make it crack every WiFi network known to man?</b><br/>
        Most of the newer routers are now impossible to crack as the WPA Key generation algorithm<br/>
        is no longer included inside the router's firmware, so there is not way to find out how the key is generated.</p>
    <p><b>Why is it taking so long to support new WiFis?</b><br/>
        I'm too busy doing other things at the same time, and getting involved in new projects of mine. <br/>
        GWPA Finder is not my main job. It still remains a hobby project.</p>
    <p><b>What's the point of updates if they don't support any newer routers?</b><br/>
        Updates are vital as they fix bugs and compatibility issues. <br/>
        You are not obligated to install a new update if your current app versionis working fine</p>
    <p><b>Screen Overlay Detected! Don't know what to do</b><br/>
        That's a bug in android 6</p>
    <p><b>Wtf dude Why does your app require Location permissions? Why do you need to know my location?</b><br/>
        That's another bug (or a feature if you wish) in Androids 6 and newers</p>
    <p><b>There are too many ads. I hate ads</b><br/>
        You can remove them from the...</p>
    <p><b>How can I contribute to the app?</b><br/>
        sent label pic underneath the router</p>
