After the tremendous success of my first Library [MayI](/posts/mayi/) :P I decided to make another one. In general I like to make stuff I wanna use in my
personal projects but before I get to that step, I always do a research first in the abundance of open source libraries to find something that could fit my needs.
So that's what I did but to my surprise I only came across one or two outdated libraries that wouldn't fulfill my expectations.

Therefore I would like to introduce to you **_WiFi Utils_**. A library that provides a set of convenience methods for managing WiFi State, WiFi Scan, And
WiFi Connection to Hotspots. If you have ever worked with `WifiManager` you should know how painful it is to make a simple wifi network scan or even worse
to connect to a hotspot programmatically. So that's what my new library is all about. To make it easier for me and hopefully for other developers as well
to do those kind of tasks from Java code.
