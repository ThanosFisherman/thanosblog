I'd like to introduce **MayI**  my very first attempt at making Android libraries. It's
yet another library that simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime for devices that run Android Marshmallow and above.

<!--more-->

As of Androids Marshmallow and above a new functionality has been added that lets users grant or deny permissions while an app is running instead of granting them all
together when installing it. This approach gives the user more control over applications but requires developers to add lots of code to support it.

This library aims to reduce boilerplate code needed to request permissions at runtime by featuring a simple chainable API designed the way I want it.
You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/ThanosFisherman/MayI" target="_blank">here.</a>

Usage
-----

### Single Permission
To request a **single permission** using this library you just need to call `Mayi` with a valid `Activity` and use `withPermission` method:

```java:nl
public MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity 
{
	@Override 
	public void onCreate() 
	{
	    super.onCreate();
	    Mayi.withActivity(MainActivity.this)
            .withPermission(Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS)
            .onResult(permission -> permissionResultSingle(permission))
            .onRationale((permission, token) -> permissionRationaleSingle(permission,token))
            .check()
	}
}
```

`permissionResultSingle` and `permissionRationaleSingle` could be custom-defined methods of your own that would deal accordingly in each situation. For Example:

```java:nl
 private void permissionResultSingle(PermissionBean permission)
 {
     Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "PERMISSION RESULT " + permission.toString(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
 }
 
 private void permissionRationaleSingle(PermissionBean bean, PermissionToken token)
 {
     Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Should show rationale for " + bean.getSimpleName() + " permission", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
     token.skipPermissionRequest();   
 }
```

### Multiple Permissions
Similarly to request **multiple permissions** at once you just need to call `Mayi` with a valid `Activity` but this time use `withPermissions` method
to specify more than one permissions. Furthermore the lambda expressions from the example above could be replaced with method references like so:

```java:nl
public MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity 
{
	@Override 
	public void onCreate() 
	{
	    super.onCreate();
	    Mayi.withActivity(this)
            .withPermissions(Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
            .onRationale(this::permissionRationaleMulti)
            .onResult(this::permissionResultMulti)
            .check()
	}
}
```

Again some possible custom-defined methods for the above example could look something like:

```java:nl
private void permissionResultMulti(PermissionBean[] permissions)
{
    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "MULTI PERMISSION RESULT " + Arrays.deepToString(permissions), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}

private void permissionRationaleMulti(PermissionBean[] permissions, PermissionToken token)
{
    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Rationales for Multiple Permissions " + Arrays.deepToString(permissions), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    token.continuePermissionRequest();
}
```

**NOTE:** All of the examples presented here, use [Retrolambda](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda) plugin to make the whole code more compact.
You are not required to use it if you don't want to.

### Error handling
If you think there is going to be an error in your Mayi integration, just call a `onErrorListener`:

```java:nl
    Mayi.withActivity(this)
    .withPermissions(Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
    .onRationale(this::permissionRationaleMulti)
    .onResult(this::permissionResultMulti)
    .onErrorListener(this::inCaseOfError)
    .check());
    
private void inCaseOfError(Exception e)
{
    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "ERROR " + e.toString(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
```

The library will then notify you when something unexpected happens.

Add it to your project
----------------------

Simply add the following to your **app module** `build.gradle` file  

```groovy:nl
dependencies {
   compile 'com.thanosfisherman.mayi:mayi:<latest version here>'
}
```

And don't forget to replace `<latest version here>` with the latest version library's number you see below.

Library Flow
------------
* The first time this library runs, system permission promt will appear asking for the user to either deny or allow the permission.
Next `onResult()` method will be called that includes the result of the user's choice.
* If user denied the permission the first time (but didn't check "don't ask again" option) then `onRationale` will be the first method to be called next
time this library runs. Inside `onRationale` method you now have 3 options. 
    * Call `token.continuePermissionRequest()` method which shows again system dialog prompt and then calls `onResult()` that includes the user's choice.
    * Call `token.skipPermissionRequest()` method which will skip showing system dialog prompt and immediately call `onResult()` that includes the user's choice.
    * Call none of the 2 above thus terminating the flow after `onRationale` finishes its execution.
* If user denied the permission by checking _"don't ask again"_ then `onResult()` will be called that includes the result of the user's choice.

below is a flow chart that visualizes the library's flow described above.
